    "Here is a batch-prep plan for proteins to get your week started, focusing on halal options that fit your dietary needs and avoid your recently consumed proteins (lamb, chicken, salmon). This plan is designed to be versatile for your meals throughout the week.\n\n**Batch Protein Prep Plan (Sunday)**\n\nThis plan focuses on preparing 3-4 different protein sources that can be used in various meals.\n\n1.  **Halal Beef Sirloin Steak (Grill/Stovetop):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1.5 lbs\n    *   **Preparation:** Season generously with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and your preferred halal-friendly herbs (like rosemary or thyme). Grill or pan-sear to your desired doneness (medium-rare to medium is recommended for best texture when reheated). Let it rest, then slice or cube.\n    *   **Storage:** Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\n2.  **Halal Turkey Breast (Grill/Oven):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1.5 lbs\n    *   **Preparation:** Season with salt, pepper, paprika, and a touch of cumin. You can grill whole breasts or cut into large chunks for grilling/roasting. If roasting, aim for an internal temperature of 165°F.\n    *   **Storage:** Once cooled, slice or cube and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\n3.  **Halal White Fish (e.g., Cod, Haddock, Tilapia) (Bake/Air Fryer):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1.5 lbs\n    *   **Preparation:** Season with lemon pepper, dill, and a pinch of salt. You can bake fillets in the oven or air fry them until cooked through and flaky.\n    *   **Storage:** Allow to cool completely before storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days (fish is best consumed within a few days).\n\n4.  **Halal Ground Beef (Stovetop):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1 lb\n    *   **Preparation:** Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain any excess fat. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of onion powder.\n    *   **Storage:** Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\n**Tips for Using Your Batch-Prepped Proteins:**\n\n*   **Salads:** Add sliced steak, turkey, or flaked fish to green salads.\n*   **Stir-fries:** Use cubed steak or turkey with low-glycemic vegetables.\n*   **Bowls:** Combine ground beef or turkey with cauliflower rice and non-starchy vegetables.\n*   **Wraps/Lettuce Cups:** Use any of the prepped proteins with low-carb tortillas or large lettuce leaves.\n*   **Quick Meals:** Reheat portions of the prepped proteins to add to quick meals like omelets or to serve alongside steamed vegetables.\n\nThis batch prep will provide a solid foundation for your protein intake throughout the week, making meal assembly much faster while adhering to your dietary requirements.",

This plan is designed to be versatile for your meals throughout the week.\n\n**Batch Protein Prep Plan (Sunday)**\n\nThis plan focuses on preparing 3-4 different protein sources that can be used in various meals.\n\n1.  **Halal Beef Sirloin Steak (Grill/Stovetop):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1.5 lbs\n    *   **Preparation:** Season generously with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and your preferred halal-friendly herbs (like rosemary or thyme). Grill or pan-sear to your desired doneness (medium-rare to medium is recommended for best texture when reheated). Let it rest, then slice or cube.\n    *   **Storage:** Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\n2.  **Halal Turkey Breast (Grill/Oven):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1.5 lbs\n    *   **Preparation:** Season with salt, pepper, paprika, and a touch of cumin. You can grill whole breasts or cut into large chunks for grilling/roasting. If roasting, aim for an internal temperature of 165°F.\n    *   **Storage:** Once cooled, slice or cube and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\n3.  **Halal White Fish (e.g., Cod, Haddock, Tilapia) (Bake/Air Fryer):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1.5 lbs\n    *   **Preparation:** Season with lemon pepper, dill, and a pinch of salt. You can bake fillets in the oven or air fry them until cooked through and flaky.\n    *   **Storage:** Allow to cool completely before storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days (fish is best consumed within a few days).\n\n4.  **Halal Ground Beef (Stovetop):**\n    *   **Quantity:** 1 lb\n    *   **Preparation:** Brown the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain any excess fat. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of onion powder.\n    *   **Storage:** Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n\n**Tips for Using Your Batch-Prepped Proteins:**\n\n*   **Salads:** Add sliced steak, turkey, or flaked fish to green salads.\n*   **Stir-fries:** Use cubed steak or turkey with low-glycemic vegetables.\n*   **Bowls:** Combine ground beef or turkey with cauliflower rice and non-starchy vegetables.\n*   **Wraps/Lettuce Cups:** Use any of the prepped proteins with low-carb tortillas or large lettuce leaves.\n*   **Quick Meals:** Reheat portions of the prepped proteins to add to quick meals like omelets or to serve alongside steamed vegetables.\n\nThis batch prep will provide a solid foundation for your protein intake throughout the week, making meal assembly much faster while adhering to your dietary requirements.\nUser: Show net carbs next to each meal.\nAgent: Here is your 7-day halal meal plan, designed to meet your daily targets of approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein, with a low-glycemic focus, using US units.
