If you are planning to cook for both weeks consecutively, you can combine these lists.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n*   **Dry vs. Cooked Weight:** The quantities listed for grains and legumes are for the *dry* weight. The actual cooked weight will be significantly higher.\n*   **Frozen vs. Fresh:** For vegetables like carrots, peas, and corn, using frozen is often more convenient and cost-effective, especially for microwave and rice cooker preparation.\n*   **Pantry Staples:** Remember to check your stock of cooking oil (e.g., olive oil, sesame oil), soy sauce or tamari, vinegar, herbs, and spices.\n",
