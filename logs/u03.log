I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. I will also include a batch-prep plan for proteins at the start of the week, and show net carbs next t
[2025-12-02 01:13:25.566422] User: Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
[2025-12-02 01:13:32.263964] Assistant: Okay, I can help you swap tonight's dinner for a grillable and halal option that fits your macros.

**Dinner (approx. 600 calories, 50g protein, 15g net carbs):**

[2025-12-02 01:29:54.847695] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-02 01:30:05.674405] Assistant: Okay, here is a 7-day halal meal plan, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day, with a low-glycemic focus, utilizing the grill or air fryer, using US units, capping dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs. I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. Net carbs will be shown next to each meal.

[2025-12-02 01:30:34.791962] Assistant: Yes, we can adjust the breakfast plan to include an additional 10-15g of protein without significantly increasing the daily calorie count. Here's how we can achieve that:

1.  **Increase Egg Whites:** Egg whites are a low-calorie, high-protein option. Adding 2-3 more egg whites to your breakfast can easily provide an extra 10-15g of protein.
2.  **Add Halal Chicken or Turkey:** Incorporating a small portion (1-2 oz) of grilled halal chicken or turkey breast can boost the protein content without

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 01:30:25.382046] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 01:30:34.791962] Assistant: Yes, we can adjust the breakfast plan to include an additional 10-15g of protein without significantly increasing the daily calorie count. Here's how we can achieve that:

1.  **Increase Egg Whites:** Egg whites are a low-calorie, high-protein option. Adding 2-3 more egg whites to your breakfast can easily provide an extra 10-15g of protein.
2.  **Add Halal Chicken or Turkey:** Incorporating a small portion (1-2 oz) of grilled halal chicken or turkey breast can boost the protein content without 
[2025-12-02 01:30:37.564023] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 01:30:45.597253] Assistant: Okay, here is a 7-day halal meal plan, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day, with a low-glycemic focus, utilizing the grill or air fryer, using US units, capping dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs. I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. Net carbs will be shown next to each meal.

**Batch Prep (Proteins):**

*   **Grill 4 lbs Halal Chicken Thighs
[2025-12-02 01:30:53.090096] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).

[2025-12-02 19:59:04.691430] User: Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
[2025-12-02 19:59:13.504449] Assistant: Okay, I can help you find a grillable halal dinner option that fits your macros and avoids repeats.

How about **Grilled Halal Chicken and Halloumi Skewers with Bell Peppers and Zucchini**?

Here's a possible breakdown:

*   **Halal Chicken Thighs (5 oz):** Approximately 300 calories, 40g protein, 0g net carbs
*   **Halloumi Cheese (2 oz):** Approximately 150 calories, 10g protein, 1g net carbs
*   **Bell Peppers and Zucchini (1 cup each):** Approximately 70 calories, 3g protein, 10g net carbs,

I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. Net carbs will be shown next to each meal.

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
======================================================================
2025-12-02 20:10:04 [final] answer(len=606): I can help with that. To add 10-15g of protein to breakfast without significantly increasing calories, I can suggest a few options:

1.  **Add Egg Whites:** Adding 2-3 egg whites to your existing egg dishes can boost protein by about 6-9g per 2 egg whites, with minimal calorie increase.
2.  **Lean Halal Turkey or Chicken:** Incorporating 1-2 ounces of lean halal turkey or chicken breast adds approximately 8-16g of protein.
3.  **Cottage Cheese:** Adding 1/2 cup of low-fat halal cottage cheese pr

I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed.

[2025-12-02 20:10:12.925680] Assistant: I can help with that. To add 10-15g of protein to breakfast without significantly increasing calories, I can suggest a few options:

1.  **Add Egg Whites:** Adding 2-3 egg whites to your existing egg dishes can boost protein by about 6-9g per 2 egg whites, with minimal calorie increase.
2.  **Lean Halal Turkey or Chicken:** Incorporating 1-2 ounces of lean halal turkey or chicken breast adds approximately 8-16g of protein.
3.  **Cottage Cheese:** Adding 1/2 cup of low-fat halal cottage cheese pr

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
======================================================================
2025-12-02 20:10:15 [final] answer(len=1451): Okay, I can help you with a cook-once, use-twice batch prep plan for two halal proteins. Based on your preferences and equipment, I recommend:

1.  **Halal Chicken Thighs:** Versatile for salads, skewers, and main courses.

Here's a cook-once, use-twice plan for each:

I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed.

[2025-12-02 20:10:12.925680] Assistant: I can help with that. To add 10-15g of protein to breakfast without significantly increasing calories, I can suggest a few options:

1.  **Add Egg Whites:** Adding 2-3 egg whites to your existing egg dishes can boost protein by about 6-9g per 2 egg whites, with minimal calorie increase.
2.  **Lean Halal Turkey or Chicken:** Incorporating 1-2 ounces of lean halal turkey or chicken breast adds approximately 8-16g of protein.

1.  **Halal Chicken Thighs:** Versatile for salads, skewers, and main courses.
2.  **Halal Ground Beef:** Great for patties, crumbles, and fillings.

Here's a cook-once, use-twice plan for each:

**Halal Chicken Thighs:**

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
======================================================================
2025-12-02 20:10:28 [final] answer(len=536): Okay, I will add two halal snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday) that fit within your dietary requirements.

Here are two halal snack options for training days:

1.  **Halal Beef Jerky:** A 1-ounce serving provides approximately 9g of protein, 7g of net carbs, and about 1g of fiber. It's a convenient and portable option.
    *   Net Carbs: 7g
    *   Fiber: 1g
2.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** Two large eggs provide about 12g of protein, less than 1g of net carbs, and no fiber.

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 20:09:29.382383] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-02 20:09:40.399326] Assistant: Okay, here is a 7-day halal meal plan, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day, with a low-glycemic focus, utilizing the grill or air fryer, using US units, capping dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs. I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history and ensure fiber stays above 30g daily, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. Net carbs and fiber will be shown next to each meal, with daily totals.

[2025-12-02 20:10:04.099702] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 20:10:12.925680] Assistant: I can help with that. To add 10-15g of protein to breakfast without significantly increasing calories, I can suggest a few options:

1.  **Add Egg Whites:** Adding 2-3 egg whites to your existing egg dishes can boost protein by about 6-9g per 2 egg whites, with minimal calorie increase.
2.  **Lean Halal Turkey or Chicken:** Incorporating 1-2 ounces of lean halal turkey or chicken breast adds approximately 8-16g of protein.
3.  **Cottage Cheese:** Adding 1/2 cup of low-fat halal cottage cheese pr
[2025-12-02 20:10:15.090077] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 20:10:25.205497] Assistant: Okay, I can help you with a cook-once, use-twice batch prep plan for two halal proteins. Based on your preferences and equipment, I recommend:

1.  **Halal Chicken Thighs:** Versatile for salads, skewers, and main courses.
2.  **Halal Ground Beef:** Great for patties, crumbles, and fillings.

Here's a cook-once, use-twice plan for each:

**Halal Chicken Thighs:**

*   **Cooking Method:** Air Fryer or Grill
*   **Batch Prep:** Season 2 lbs of halal chicken thighs with Mediterranean herbs (oregano
[2025-12-02 20:10:28.007797] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 20:10:36.971309] Assistant: Okay, I will add two halal snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday) that fit within your dietary requirements.

Here are two halal snack options for training days:

1.  **Halal Beef Jerky:** A 1-ounce serving provides approximately 9g of protein, 7g of net carbs, and about 1g of fiber. It's a convenient and portable option.
    *   Net Carbs: 7g
    *   Fiber: 1g
2.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** Two large eggs provide about 12g of protein, less than 1g of net carbs, and no fiber.

[2025-12-02 20:25:06.030188] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-02 20:25:14.080626] Assistant: Okay, here is a 7-day halal meal plan designed around 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day, with a focus on low-glycemic foods. I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history, utilize your grill and air fryer where possible, cap dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs. I will also ensure that fiber does not dip below 30g on any day, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. Net carbs are listed next to each meal. This plan prioritizes eggs and chicken for breakfa

[2025-12-02 20:25:34.345104] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 20:25:37.401064] Assistant: I can adjust the breakfast plan to include 10-15g more protein without significantly raising the daily calorie count. I will adjust the portion sizes of the existing ingredients or add a small serving of a high-protein, low-calorie food like egg whites.
[2025-12-02 20:25:38.376126] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 20:25:45.774751] Assistant: Okay, I will select two halal-friendly proteins suitable for batch preparation and provide a "cook once, use twice" plan for each. Given your preferences, I will choose chicken and beef.

**Batch Prep Plan:**

**1. Halal Chicken Breast:**

*   **Cooking Method:** Air Fryer
*   **Batch Prep:** Air fry 3 lbs of halal chicken breast. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Cook at 375°F for 18-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.

    *   **Portion 1 (Lunch):**
[2025-12-02 20:25:49.860249] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 20:25:54.673752] Assistant: Okay, I will add two halal-friendly snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday). These snacks will be low-glycemic and align with your dietary goals.

**Snack Options (Training Days Only):**

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs (2):** A simple and protein-packed snack.
    *   **Nutrition (per 2 eggs):** Calories: 156, Protein: 13g, Net Carbs: 1g, Fiber: 0g
2.  **Small handful of Almonds (1/4 cup):** Provides healthy fats and some protein.

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 20:25:19.153615] User: Same carb caps as before: dinners ≤30 g net, lunches ≤40. US units. No repeats from last week.
[2025-12-02 20:25:28.054954] Assistant: Okay, here is a 7-day halal meal plan designed around 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day, with a focus on low-glycemic foods. I will avoid repeating meals from your recent history, utilize your grill and air fryer where possible, cap dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs. I will also ensure that fiber does not dip below 30g on any day, adjusting vegetable portions as needed. Net carbs are listed next to each meal. This plan prioritizes eggs and chicken for breakfa
[2025-12-02 20:25:34.345104] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 20:25:37.401064] Assistant: I can adjust the breakfast plan to include 10-15g more protein without significantly raising the daily calorie count. I will adjust the portion sizes of the existing ingredients or add a small serving of a high-protein, low-calorie food like egg whites.
[2025-12-02 20:25:38.376126] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 20:25:45.774751] Assistant: Okay, I will select two halal-friendly proteins suitable for batch preparation and provide a "cook once, use twice" plan for each. Given your preferences, I will choose chicken and beef.

**Batch Prep Plan:**

**1. Halal Chicken Breast:**

*   **Cooking Method:** Air Fryer
*   **Batch Prep:** Air fry 3 lbs of halal chicken breast. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Cook at 375°F for 18-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.

    *   **Portion 1 (Lunch):**
[2025-12-02 20:25:49.860249] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 20:25:54.673752] Assistant: Okay, I will add two halal-friendly snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday). These snacks will be low-glycemic and align with your dietary goals.

**Snack Options (Training Days Only):**

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs (2):** A simple and protein-packed snack.
    *   **Nutrition (per 2 eggs):** Calories: 156, Protein: 13g, Net Carbs: 1g, Fiber: 0g
2.  **Small handful of Almonds (1/4 cup):** Provides healthy fats and some protein.
    *   **Nutrition (per 1/4 cup):** Calories: 207, Pr
[2025-12-02 20:25:56.524813] User: Please show net carbs and fiber by meal with day totals.
[2025-12-02 20:26:00.065426] Assistant: I can provide the net carbs and fiber content for each meal, along with daily totals, once the full meal plan is complete. This will ensure accurate calculations based on the final meal compositions.

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 20:25:34.345104] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 20:25:37.401064] Assistant: I can adjust the breakfast plan to include 10-15g more protein without significantly raising the daily calorie count. I will adjust the portion sizes of the existing ingredients or add a small serving of a high-protein, low-calorie food like egg whites.
[2025-12-02 20:25:38.376126] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 20:25:45.774751] Assistant: Okay, I will select two halal-friendly proteins suitable for batch preparation and provide a "cook once, use twice" plan for each. Given your preferences, I will choose chicken and beef.

**Batch Prep Plan:**

**1. Halal Chicken Breast:**

*   **Cooking Method:** Air Fryer
*   **Batch Prep:** Air fry 3 lbs of halal chicken breast. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Cook at 375°F for 18-20 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.

    *   **Portion 1 (Lunch):**

[2025-12-02 20:26:00.065426] Assistant: I can provide the net carbs and fiber content for each meal, along with daily totals, once the full meal plan is complete. This will ensure accurate calculations based on the final meal compositions.
[2025-12-02 21:29:07.390884] User: Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
[2025-12-02 21:29:24.680876] Assistant: Okay, I can swap tonight's dinner for a grillable and halal option that meets your specifications: approximately 600 calories, 40+ grams of protein, and around 20 grams or less of net carbs. I will ensure it's something you haven't had recently.

[2025-12-02 21:29:24.680876] Assistant: Okay, I can swap tonight's dinner for a grillable and halal option that meets your specifications: approximately 600 calories, 40+ grams of protein, and around 20 grams or less of net carbs. I will ensure it's something you haven't had recently.

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
======================================================================
2025-12-02 22:03:30 [final] answer(len=1583): Okay, I will adjust the meal plan for next week to prioritize eggs and chicken for breakfast and lunch to help you feel fuller, while keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets. I will also ensure all meals are halal, low-glycemic, and utilize your grill or air fryer, with dinners capped at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs. I will also continue to monitor and boost fiber with extra vegetables if needed.

Here is the meal plan for Day 1:

**Option 1: Add Egg Whites**

*   **Current Breakfast:** 3 large eggs, scrambled with 1 cup spinach and 1 oz feta cheese. 1/2 cup cooked steel-cut oats with 1/2 cup mixed berries.

[2025-12-02 22:04:11.041792] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a "cook-once, use-twice" plan to maximize your efficiency:

**1. Halal Chicken Breast (Grilled or Air Fried)**

*   **Quantity:** 2 lbs
*   **Preparation:** Season 2 lbs of halal chicken breast with your preferred low-glycemic, halal-friendly spices (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt, pepper). You can grill or air fry these.

[2025-12-02 22:07:03.510722] Assistant: Here are two grillable and halal dinner options for tonight, keeping your preferences in mind:

**Option 1: Grilled Lamb Chops with Asparagus and a Side Salad**

[2025-12-02 22:08:10.668309] User: Please make a 2‑day halal plan around 2000 a day with ≥150 g protein, low‑glycemic focus.
[2025-12-02 22:08:18.006764] Assistant: Here is a 2-day halal meal plan focusing on low-glycemic principles, approximately 2000 calories per day, and at least 150g of protein.

    *   4 large eggs scrambled with 1 cup spinach and 1 oz feta cheese.
    *   1/2 cup cooked steel-cut oats with 1/2 cup mixed berries.
    *   *Preparation:* Scramble eggs with spinach and feta on the stove. Cook steel-cut oats according to package directions and top with berries.


[2025-12-02 22:08:21.682094] User: I’d rather use the grill or the air fryer.
[2025-12-02 22:08:26.781801] Assistant: Okay, I understand you'd prefer to use the grill or air fryer for cooking. I will incorporate this preference into the meal plan.

Since you've asked for a 2-day plan, here is Day 1, keeping in mind your daily calorie and protein goals, low-glycemic focus, halal requirement, and avoiding recent meals.

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
======================================================================
2025-12-02 22:21:29 [final] answer(len=1547): Okay, I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for next week, keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets. I'll focus on eggs and chicken as primary protein sources for breakfast and other meals, and avoid yogurt bowls. I will also adhere to your low-glycemic, US unit, and equipment preferences, along with the net carb caps for lunch (40g) and dinner (30g). I will ensure fiber is at least 30g by adding non-starchy vegetables as needed, and I will not repeat meals from your recent history. Net ca

======================================================================

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
======================================================================
2025-12-02 22:22:04 [final] answer(len=1319): Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your low-glycemic, halal, and no-yogurt-bowl preferences:

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs with a sprinkle of Everything Bagel Seasoning**
    *   **Nutrition (2 large eggs):** Approximately 140 calories, 12g protein, 0g net carbs, 10g fat.
    *   **Why it works:** Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats, providing sustained energy without a glycemic spike. The seasoning adds flavor without added carbs.

[2025-12-02 22:21:29.299312] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-02 22:21:39.167971] Assistant: Okay, I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for next week, keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets. I'll focus on eggs and chicken as primary protein sources for breakfast and other meals, and avoid yogurt bowls. I will also adhere to your low-glycemic, US unit, and equipment preferences, along with the net carb caps for lunch (40g) and dinner (30g). I will ensure fiber is at least 30g by adding non-starchy vegetables as needed, and I will not repeat meals from your recent history. Net ca

[2025-12-02 22:21:48.814357] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 22:21:55.143106] Assistant: Yes, we can add 10-15g more protein to breakfast without significantly raising daily calories by making smart choices. Here are a few options:

**Option 1: Extra Egg Whites**

*   **Add:** 3-4 large egg whites to your existing eggs.
*   **Protein Boost:** Approximately 10-12g protein.
*   **Calorie Impact:** Minimal, as egg whites are very low in calories and fat.
*   **Net Carbs:** Negligible.

**Option 2: Lean Chicken Sausage (Halal)**

*   **Add:** 1-2 links of a high-quality, low-carb halal 
[2025-12-02 22:21:56.545213] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 22:22:02.881910] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a "cook-once, use-twice" plan:

**1. Grilled Halal Chicken Thighs**

*   **Preparation:** Season approximately 2 lbs of halal chicken thighs with your preferred low-glycemic spices (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, herbs). Grill or bake until cooked through.
*   **Why it's great:** Chicken thighs are flavorful and stay moist, making them versatile for various dishes.

**2. Hard-Boiled Eggs**

*   **Preparation:*
[2025-12-02 22:22:04.400117] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 22:22:14.794747] Assistant: Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your low-glycemic, halal, and no-yogurt-bowl preferences:

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs with a sprinkle of Everything Bagel Seasoning**
    *   **Nutrition (2 large eggs):** Approximately 140 calories, 12g protein, 0g net carbs, 10g fat.
    *   **Why it works:** Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats, providing sustained energy without a glycemic spike. The seasoning adds flavor without added carbs.

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 22:21:41.498699] User: Same carb caps as before: dinners ≤30 g net, lunches ≤40. US units. No repeats from last week.
[2025-12-02 22:21:45.785420] Assistant: Okay, I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for you, keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets. I'll focus on eggs and chicken as primary protein sources for breakfast and other meals, and avoid yogurt bowls. I will also adhere to your low-glycemic, US unit, and equipment preferences, along with the net carb caps for lunch (40g) and dinner (30g). I will ensure fiber is at least 30g by adding non-starchy vegetables as needed, and I will not repeat meals from your recent history. Net carbs wi
[2025-12-02 22:21:48.814357] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 22:21:55.143106] Assistant: Yes, we can add 10-15g more protein to breakfast without significantly raising daily calories by making smart choices. Here are a few options:

**Option 1: Extra Egg Whites**

*   **Add:** 3-4 large egg whites to your existing eggs.
*   **Protein Boost:** Approximately 10-12g protein.
*   **Calorie Impact:** Minimal, as egg whites are very low in calories and fat.
*   **Net Carbs:** Negligible.

**Option 2: Lean Chicken Sausage (Halal)**

*   **Add:** 1-2 links of a high-quality, low-carb halal 
[2025-12-02 22:21:56.545213] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 22:22:02.881910] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a "cook-once, use-twice" plan:

**1. Grilled Halal Chicken Thighs**

*   **Preparation:** Season approximately 2 lbs of halal chicken thighs with your preferred low-glycemic spices (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, herbs). Grill or bake until cooked through.
*   **Why it's great:** Chicken thighs are flavorful and stay moist, making them versatile for various dishes.

**2. Hard-Boiled Eggs**

*   **Preparation:*
[2025-12-02 22:22:04.400117] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 22:22:14.794747] Assistant: Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your low-glycemic, halal, and no-yogurt-bowl preferences:

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs with a sprinkle of Everything Bagel Seasoning**
    *   **Nutrition (2 large eggs):** Approximately 140 calories, 12g protein, 0g net carbs, 10g fat.
    *   **Why it works:** Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats, providing sustained energy without a glycemic spike. The seasoning adds flavor without added carbs.

[2025-12-02 22:22:16.303724] User: Please show net carbs and fiber by meal with day totals.
[2025-12-02 22:22:19.953350] Assistant: Here is a 7-day meal plan designed to meet your specifications: 2000 kcal daily, at least 10g protein (aiming for higher with primary sources), at least 30g fiber, halal, no yogurt bowls, low-glycemic, using US units, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It also avoids repeating meals from your recent history.

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** 4-Egg Omelet with Spinach and Feta Cheese (Net Carbs: 4g, Fiber: 3g)
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 350 kcal, 30g protein, 4g net carb

Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
======================================================================
2025-12-07 10:53:20 [final] answer(len=1172): Here is a grillable, halal dinner option for tonight, keeping your preferences in mind:

**Grilled Halal Chicken Breast with Asparagus and a side of Mixed Greens Salad**

*   **Description:** A lean and flavorful grilled chicken breast served with tender grilled asparagus spears and a simple mixed greens salad with a light lemon-herb vinaigrette.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   **Chicken:** Marinate a 6 oz halal chicken breast in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and herbs (like rosemary or thyme). G

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 22:21:48.814357] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-02 22:21:55.143106] Assistant: Yes, we can add 10-15g more protein to breakfast without significantly raising daily calories by making smart choices. Here are a few options:

**Option 1: Extra Egg Whites**

*   **Add:** 3-4 large egg whites to your existing eggs.
*   **Protein Boost:** Approximately 10-12g protein.
*   **Calorie Impact:** Minimal, as egg whites are very low in calories and fat.
*   **Net Carbs:** Negligible.

**Option 2: Lean Chicken Sausage (Halal)**

*   **Add:** 1-2 links of a high-quality, low-carb halal 
[2025-12-02 22:21:56.545213] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 22:22:02.881910] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a "cook-once, use-twice" plan:

**1. Grilled Halal Chicken Thighs**

*   **Preparation:** Season approximately 2 lbs of halal chicken thighs with your preferred low-glycemic spices (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, herbs). Grill or bake until cooked through.
*   **Why it's great:** Chicken thighs are flavorful and stay moist, making them versatile for various dishes.

**2. Hard-Boiled Eggs**

*   **Preparation:*
[2025-12-02 22:22:04.400117] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 22:22:14.794747] Assistant: Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your low-glycemic, halal, and no-yogurt-bowl preferences:

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs with a sprinkle of Everything Bagel Seasoning**
    *   **Nutrition (2 large eggs):** Approximately 140 calories, 12g protein, 0g net carbs, 10g fat.
    *   **Why it works:** Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats, providing sustained energy without a glycemic spike. The seasoning adds flavor without added carbs.

[2025-12-02 22:22:16.303724] User: Please show net carbs and fiber by meal with day totals.
[2025-12-02 22:22:19.953350] Assistant: Here is a 7-day meal plan designed to meet your specifications: 2000 kcal daily, at least 10g protein (aiming for higher with primary sources), at least 30g fiber, halal, no yogurt bowls, low-glycemic, using US units, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It also avoids repeating meals from your recent history.

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** 4-Egg Omelet with Spinach and Feta Cheese (Net Carbs: 4g, Fiber: 3g)
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 350 kcal, 30g protein, 4g net carb
[2025-12-07 10:53:20.284001] User: Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
[2025-12-07 10:53:28.545924] Assistant: Here is a grillable, halal dinner option for tonight, keeping your preferences in mind:

**Grilled Halal Chicken Breast with Asparagus and a side of Mixed Greens Salad**

*   **Description:** A lean and flavorful grilled chicken breast served with tender grilled asparagus spears and a simple mixed greens salad with a light lemon-herb vinaigrette.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   **Chicken:** Marinate a 6 oz halal chicken breast in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and herbs (like rosemary or thyme). G

=== RECENT CONVERSATION ===
[2025-12-02 22:21:56.545213] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-02 22:22:02.881910] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a "cook-once, use-twice" plan:

**1. Grilled Halal Chicken Thighs**

*   **Preparation:** Season approximately 2 lbs of halal chicken thighs with your preferred low-glycemic spices (e.g., paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, herbs). Grill or bake until cooked through.
*   **Why it's great:** Chicken thighs are flavorful and stay moist, making them versatile for various dishes.

**2. Hard-Boiled Eggs**

*   **Preparation:*
[2025-12-02 22:22:04.400117] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-02 22:22:14.794747] Assistant: Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your low-glycemic, halal, and no-yogurt-bowl preferences:

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs with a sprinkle of Everything Bagel Seasoning**
    *   **Nutrition (2 large eggs):** Approximately 140 calories, 12g protein, 0g net carbs, 10g fat.
    *   **Why it works:** Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats, providing sustained energy without a glycemic spike. The seasoning adds flavor without added carbs.

[2025-12-02 22:22:16.303724] User: Please show net carbs and fiber by meal with day totals.
[2025-12-02 22:22:19.953350] Assistant: Here is a 7-day meal plan designed to meet your specifications: 2000 kcal daily, at least 10g protein (aiming for higher with primary sources), at least 30g fiber, halal, no yogurt bowls, low-glycemic, using US units, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It also avoids repeating meals from your recent history.

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** 4-Egg Omelet with Spinach and Feta Cheese (Net Carbs: 4g, Fiber: 3g)
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 350 kcal, 30g protein, 4g net carb
[2025-12-07 10:53:20.284001] User: Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
[2025-12-07 10:53:28.545924] Assistant: Here is a grillable, halal dinner option for tonight, keeping your preferences in mind:

**Grilled Halal Chicken Breast with Asparagus and a side of Mixed Greens Salad**

*   **Description:** A lean and flavorful grilled chicken breast served with tender grilled asparagus spears and a simple mixed greens salad with a light lemon-herb vinaigrette.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   **Chicken:** Marinate a 6 oz halal chicken breast in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and herbs (like rosemary or thyme). G
[2025-12-07 10:55:08.403945] User: Please make a 2‑day halal plan around 2000 a day with ≥150 g protein, low‑glycemic focus.
[2025-12-07 10:55:21.253324] Assistant: Here is a 2-day halal meal plan focused on low-glycemic options, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day.

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** 4-Egg Omelet with Spinach and Feta Cheese
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 350 kcal, 30g protein, 4g net carbs, 22g fat, 3g fiber
*   **Lunch:** Large Salad with Grilled Halal Chicken Breast, Mixed Greens, Cucumber, Bell Peppers, and a Light Olive Oil and Lemon Juice Dressing
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 450 kcal, 45g

[2025-12-02 22:22:14.794747] Assistant: Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your low-glycemic, halal, and no-yogurt-bowl preferences:

1.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs with a sprinkle of Everything Bagel Seasoning**
    *   **Nutrition (2 large eggs):** Approximately 140 calories, 12g protein, 0g net carbs, 10g fat.
    *   **Why it works:** Eggs are a great source of protein and healthy fats, providing sustained energy without a glycemic spike. The seasoning adds flavor without added carbs.

[2025-12-02 22:22:19.953350] Assistant: Here is a 7-day meal plan designed to meet your specifications: 2000 kcal daily, at least 10g protein (aiming for higher with primary sources), at least 30g fiber, halal, no yogurt bowls, low-glycemic, using US units, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It also avoids repeating meals from your recent history.

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** 4-Egg Omelet with Spinach and Feta Cheese (Net Carbs: 4g, Fiber: 3g)
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 350 kcal, 30g protein, 4g net carb
[2025-12-07 10:53:20.284001] User: Tonight, can we swap dinner for something grillable and halal? Roughly 600 cals, 40+ protein, and keep net carbs low like before—around 20 g or less. No repeats.
[2025-12-07 10:53:28.545924] Assistant: Here is a grillable, halal dinner option for tonight, keeping your preferences in mind:

**Grilled Halal Chicken Breast with Asparagus and a side of Mixed Greens Salad**

*   **Description:** A lean and flavorful grilled chicken breast served with tender grilled asparagus spears and a simple mixed greens salad with a light lemon-herb vinaigrette.
*   **Preparation:**
    *   **Chicken:** Marinate a 6 oz halal chicken breast in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, and herbs (like rosemary or thyme). G

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** 4-Egg Omelet with Spinach and Feta Cheese

*   **Lunch:** Large Salad with Grilled Halal Chicken Breast, Mixed Greens, Cucumber, Bell Peppers, and a Light Olive Oil and Lemon Juice Dressing
    *   *Nutrition (approximate):* 450 kcal, 45g
[2025-12-07 10:55:25.075966] User: I’d rather use the grill or the air fryer.
[2025-12-07 10:55:29.588868] Assistant: Okay, I understand you'd prefer to use the grill or air fryer for your meals. I will keep this in mind when creating your meal plan.

To help me create the best plan for you, could you please tell me what day you would like the meal plan to start?

I will prioritize using your grill and air fryer, avoid yogurt bowls, and ensure no meals are repeated from your recent history. If any day's fiber dips below 30g, I will increase the non-starchy vegetables to compensate without exceeding the carb caps.

Show net carbs next to each meal.
======================================================================
2025-12-07 11:00:10 [final] answer(len=3099): Here is your 7-day halal meal plan, with net carbs displayed next to each meal, adhering to all your preferences: approximately 2000 kcal daily, at least 150g protein, at least 30g fiber, low-glycemic, using US units, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It prioritizes grill/air fryer use, avoids yogurt bowls and repeats from your recent history, and will increase non-starchy vegetables if fiber dips below 30g.

======================================================================
2025-12-07 11:01:22 [final] answer(len=3159): Understood! I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for you, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day. It will be low-glycemic, use US units, and adhere to your net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. I will prioritize using your grill and air fryer, avoid yogurt bowls, and ensure no meals are repeated from your recent history. If any day's fiber dips below 30g, I will increase the non-starchy vegetables to compensate without exceeding the carb caps. I

[2025-12-07 10:59:53.299744] Assistant: Okay, I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for you, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day. It will be low-glycemic, use US units, and adhere to your net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. I will prioritize using your grill and air fryer, avoid yogurt bowls, and ensure no meals are repeated from your recent history. If any day's fiber dips below 30g, I will increase the non-starchy vegetables to compensate without exceeding the carb caps.

[2025-12-07 11:00:08.752304] Assistant: Here is a batch-prep plan for proteins to kick off your week, designed to make meal assembly easier:

**Batch Prep Plan:**

1.  **Grill or Air Fry Halal Chicken Breasts/Thighs:** Prepare 4-6 servings of plain grilled or air-fried chicken breasts or thighs. This versatile protein can be used in salads, lettuce wraps, or as a main component of meals.
2.  **Hard-Boil Eggs:** Prepare a dozen hard-boiled eggs. These are great for quick breakfasts, snacks, or adding to salads.

It prioritizes grill/air fryer use, avoids yogurt bowls and repeats from your recent history, and will increase non-starchy vegetables if fiber dips below 30g.

=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
======================================================================
2025-12-07 11:01:52 [final] answer(len=1740): Yes, we can adjust your breakfast to include an additional 10-15g of protein without significantly increasing your daily calorie intake. This can be achieved by slightly increasing the portion sizes of your protein sources or by adding a small, protein-dense component.

Here are a few options for your breakfast, keeping in mind your preferences for eggs and chicken, and the need to stay within your overall calorie and net carb goals:

[2025-12-07 11:00:08.752304] Assistant: Here is a batch-prep plan for proteins to kick off your week, designed to make meal assembly easier:

**Batch Prep Plan:**

1.  **Grill or Air Fry Halal Chicken Breasts/Thighs:** Prepare 4-6 servings of plain grilled or air-fried chicken breasts or thighs. This versatile protein can be used in salads, lettuce wraps, or as a main component of meals.
2.  **Hard-Boil Eggs:** Prepare a dozen hard-boiled eggs. These are great for quick breakfasts, snacks, or adding to salads.

[2025-12-07 11:00:23.737149] Assistant: Here is your 7-day halal meal plan, with net carbs displayed next to each meal, adhering to all your preferences: approximately 2000 kcal daily, at least 150g protein, at least 30g fiber, low-glycemic, using US units, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It prioritizes grill/air fryer use, avoids yogurt bowls and repeats from your recent history, and will increase non-starchy vegetables if fiber dips below 30g.

[2025-12-07 11:01:22.710878] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-07 11:01:35.797624] Assistant: Understood! I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for you, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day. It will be low-glycemic, use US units, and adhere to your net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. I will prioritize using your grill and air fryer, avoid yogurt bowls, and ensure no meals are repeated from your recent history. If any day's fiber dips below 30g, I will increase the non-starchy vegetables to compensate without exceeding the carb caps. I

[2025-12-07 11:01:48.239006] Assistant: Here is your 7-day halal meal plan for the upcoming week, keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It prioritizes your grill and air fryer, avoids yogurt bowls, and will not repeat meals from last week. Non-starchy vegetables will be increased if fiber dips below 30g, while staying within carb limits.

[2025-12-07 11:01:52.939851] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-07 11:02:01.395746] Assistant: Yes, we can adjust your breakfast to include an additional 10-15g of protein without significantly increasing your daily calorie intake. This can be achieved by slightly increasing the portion sizes of your protein sources or by adding a small, protein-dense component.

Here are a few options for your breakfast, keeping in mind your preferences for eggs and chicken, and the need to stay within your overall calorie and net carb goals:

**Option 1: Increased Egg Whites**

[2025-12-07 11:01:52.939851] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-07 11:02:01.395746] Assistant: Yes, we can adjust your breakfast to include an additional 10-15g of protein without significantly increasing your daily calorie intake. This can be achieved by slightly increasing the portion sizes of your protein sources or by adding a small, protein-dense component.

[2025-12-07 11:01:22.710878] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-07 11:01:35.797624] Assistant: Understood! I will create a 7-day halal meal plan for you, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day. It will be low-glycemic, use US units, and adhere to your net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. I will prioritize using your grill and air fryer, avoid yogurt bowls, and ensure no meals are repeated from your recent history. If any day's fiber dips below 30g, I will increase the non-starchy vegetables to compensate without exceeding the carb caps. I

[2025-12-07 11:01:48.239006] Assistant: Here is your 7-day halal meal plan for the upcoming week, keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets, with net carb caps of 40g for lunch and 30g for dinner. It prioritizes your grill and air fryer, avoids yogurt bowls, and will not repeat meals from last week. Non-starchy vegetables will be increased if fiber dips below 30g, while staying within carb limits.

[2025-12-07 11:01:52.939851] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-07 11:02:01.395746] Assistant: Yes, we can adjust your breakfast to include an additional 10-15g of protein without significantly increasing your daily calorie intake. This can be achieved by slightly increasing the portion sizes of your protein sources or by adding a small, protein-dense component.

Here are a few options for your breakfast, keeping in mind your preferences for eggs and chicken, and the need to stay within your overall calorie and net carb goals:

[2025-12-07 11:02:10.495051] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a "cook-once, use-twice" plan:

**Proteins to Batch Prep:**

1.  **Halal Chicken Breasts:** Versatile, lean, and fits your primary protein preference.
2.  **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** Quick to prepare and a great addition to breakfasts or snacks.

[2025-12-07 11:32:37.265802] Assistant: Here is your 7-day halal meal plan, designed to meet your daily targets of approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein, with a low-glycemic focus, using US units. This plan prioritizes using your grill and air fryer, caps dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs, avoids repeating proteins from your recent meals (lamb, chicken, salmon), and ensures fiber intake is at least 30g daily by adjusting vegetables. Net carbs are shown next to each meal.

I'll focus on incorporating eggs and other suitable proteins to ensure you feel fuller, and will avoid yogurt bowls. I will also continue to adhere to your low-glycemic, halal requirements, use your available equipment (air fryer, stovetop, stove, oven, grill), US units, and avoid your disliked proteins (chicken, salmon, lamb), as well as any proteins repeated from your recent meals.

[2025-12-07 11:34:02.072414] Assistant: Yes, we can add approximately 10-15g more protein to breakfast without significantly raising daily calories. This can be achieved by slightly increasing the portion sizes of protein-rich breakfast components or by adding a small, protein-dense side.

Here are a few options for your breakfast tomorrow:

**Option 1: Increased Egg Whites**

[2025-12-07 11:33:26.353371] User: For next week, keep the 2000 kcal and 150 g protein setup, but yogurt bowls weren’t keeping me full—eggs and chicken worked great.
[2025-12-07 11:33:39.015105] Assistant: Okay, I understand. For next week's meal plan, we'll maintain the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets. I'll focus on incorporating eggs and other suitable proteins to ensure you feel fuller, and will avoid yogurt bowls. I will also continue to adhere to your low-glycemic, halal requirements, use your available equipment (air fryer, stovetop, stove, oven, grill), US units, and avoid your disliked proteins (chicken, salmon, lamb), as well as any proteins repeated from your recent meals. I will also
[2025-12-07 11:33:41.709813] User: Same carb caps as before: dinners ≤30 g net, lunches ≤40. US units. No repeats from last week.
[2025-12-07 11:33:49.382688] Assistant: Here is a 7-day halal meal plan for next week, designed to meet your daily targets of approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein, with a low-glycemic focus. This plan prioritizes using your grill and air fryer, caps dinners at 30g net carbs and lunches at 40g net carbs, and avoids repeating proteins from your recent meals (lamb, chicken, salmon, beef sirloin steak, ground beef, turkey breast, white fish, cod, eggs, cottage cheese). Fiber intake will be at least 30g daily.

[2025-12-07 11:33:54.419402] User: Can we add about 10–15 g more protein to breakfast without raising daily calories?
[2025-12-07 11:34:02.072414] Assistant: Yes, we can add approximately 10-15g more protein to breakfast without significantly raising daily calories. This can be achieved by slightly increasing the portion sizes of protein-rich breakfast components or by adding a small, protein-dense side.

Here are a few options for your breakfast tomorrow:

**Option 1: Increased Egg Whites**

*   **Current:** 3 large eggs (approx. 18g protein, 210 kcal)
*   **Adjusted:** 3 large eggs + 4 egg whites (approx. 30g protein, 270 kcal)

[2025-12-07 11:34:04.058266] User: I want to batch‑prep two proteins—pick which and give me a cook‑once, use‑twice plan.
[2025-12-07 11:34:11.444229] Assistant: Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a cook-once, use-twice plan that fits your dietary needs and preferences:

**Batch Prep Protein Choices:**

1.  **Halal Beef Sirloin Steak:** This is a versatile protein that can be grilled, pan-seared, or roasted. It's a good source of iron and protein.
2.  **Halal Turkey Breast Tenderloin:** This is a lean protein that can be roasted or pan-seared. It's a good alternative to chicken and can be seasoned in many ways.

**Cook-Once, Use-
[2025-12-07 11:34:13.481507] User: Add two snack options on training days only (Mon/Thu).
[2025-12-07 11:34:22.816921] Assistant: Here are two snack options for your training days (Monday and Thursday), keeping in mind your dietary needs and preferences:

**Snack Option 1: Beef Jerky (Halal)**

*   **Description:** High-protein, portable, and satisfying. Ensure it's halal-certified and low in added sugars for a lower glycemic impact.
*   **Serving Size:** 1 oz (approximately 28g)

2025-12-07 19:34:30 [final] answer(len=360): The main difference between an air fryer and a grill is how they cook food. An air fryer uses hot, circulating air to cook, while a grill uses direct heat. Some air fryers also come with a grill plate, allowing them to perform grilling functions. The settings on an air fryer can also be adjusted to mimic grilling, with lower fan speeds for a grilling effect.
