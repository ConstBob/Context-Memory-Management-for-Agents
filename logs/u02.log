2025-10-22 16:54:28 [final] answer(len=1074): Okay, I can help you create a split grocery list for two weeks with quantities in grams. To make this list as useful as possible, I need a little more information.  Please tell me:

1.  **What kind of meals are you planning to make?** (e.g., vegetarian, meat-based, specific cuisines like Italian or Mexican, etc.)
2.  **How many people are you cooking for?**
3.  **Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences?** (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free, allergies, etc.)
4.  **What is your budget?**
