2025-10-22 16:56:20 [final] answer(len=336): I can create a consolidated shopping list split into pantry vs. fresh items based on the provided search results. However, to make it more tailored to your needs, I need you to provide me with the specific items you want to include on your shopping list. Once you provide that, I will organize them into "Pantry" and "Fresh" categories.

1. Would you like me to suggest some alternative fish or protein sources?
2. Were we previously discussing a specific meal plan or recipe that included tuna?

======================================================================
2025-11-30 15:59:04 [final] answer(len=2235): I'll help you create a Japanese/Thai-inspired pescatarian meal plan that meets your requirements. Based on the search results and considering your needs (2200 calories/day, 130g+ protein, no tuna), here's a suggested 7-day plan:

Day 1:
- Breakfast: Protein smoothie with spinach, berries, and plant protein powder

Rotate the main seafood so none shows up more than twice.
======================================================================
2025-11-30 15:59:41 [final] answer(len=912): I'll help you rotate the seafood to ensure variety. Let me analyze the meals and make adjustments to avoid having any seafood appear more than twice.

Looking at the meals, I'll make the following changes while maintaining a good variety of seafood options:

1. Keep the Grilled Salmon with lemon and herbs
2. Change one salmon dish to Grilled Mahi Mahi
3. Keep the Shrimp Scampi
4. Change one shrimp dish to Pan-Seared Cod
5. Change one fish dish to Seared Tuna Steak
6. Keep the Baked Tilapia

======================================================================
2025-11-30 15:59:49 [final] answer(len=996): Based on your request for US units and maintaining high fiber intake (30+ grams), here are some key points to consider:

1. Fiber Target: Aim for at least 30 grams of fiber per day, which aligns with general health recommendations.

2. Good Sources of Fiber (in US units):
- 1 cup of beans/lentils: 15-16g fiber
- 1 cup of oatmeal: 4g fiber
- 1 medium apple with skin: 4.5g fiber
- 1 cup of raspberries: 8g fiber
- 1 cup of broccoli: 5g fiber
- 1 medium pear: 5.5g fiber
- 2 tablespoons of chia seeds

Watch the sodium—call it out per meal and keep the day under about 2300 mg.
======================================================================
2025-11-30 16:00:04 [final] answer(len=775): I understand you want to monitor sodium intake and keep it under 2300 mg per day. To help distribute this evenly, we can aim for roughly 767 mg of sodium per meal (based on three meals), which I calculated by dividing 2300 by 3.

Here's how we can approach sodium distribution throughout the day:

Breakfast: Aim for 600-700 mg sodium
Lunch: Aim for 700-800 mg sodium
Dinner: Aim for 700-800 mg sodium

This leaves a small buffer (100-300 mg) for any snacks during the day.
