[2025-12-02 22:20:58.866914] Assistant: Here is a 7-day Japanese/Thai-leaning pescatarian meal plan, aiming for approximately 2200 kcals and 130g+ protein per day, with a focus on fiber and avoiding previously used dishes. Sodium will be called out per meal.

**Day 1**

*   **Breakfast:** Miso-Glazed Cod with Roasted Asparagus and Quinoa
    *   4 oz cod fillet, glazed with 1 tbsp white miso paste and 1 tsp mirin, then baked.
    *   1 cup roasted asparagus.
    *   1/2 cup cooked quinoa.
    *   **Nutrition Estimate:** Calories: ~450
[2025-12-02 22:21:02.140824] User: Rotate the main seafood so none shows up more than twice.
