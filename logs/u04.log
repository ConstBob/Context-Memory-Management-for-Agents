2025-10-22 16:56:20 [final] answer(len=336): I can create a consolidated shopping list split into pantry vs. fresh items based on the provided search results. However, to make it more tailored to your needs, I need you to provide me with the specific items you want to include on your shopping list. Once you provide that, I will organize them into "Pantry" and "Fresh" categories.
