=== CURRENT QUESTION ===
At the office I’ve only got a microwave. Cups/oz are easiest.
======================================================================
2025-11-30 15:47:13 [final] answer(len=660): Based on the search results, I can help you with microwave mug recipes that use simple cup/ounce measurements. The ideal mug size for most microwave mug recipes is 6-8 ounces (about ¾ to 1 cup). Using the right size mug is important to prevent overflow while cooking.

Here are some key tips for microwave mug cooking:
1. Use a 6-8 ounce microwave-safe mug
2. If using a smaller mug (less than 6 oz), you risk overflow and mess
3. Cook in 30-second intervals for better control
4. Mix wet ingredients

======================================================================
2025-11-30 15:49:26 [final] answer(len=745): Based on your situation with only having access to a microwave and preferring cup/oz measurements, I can suggest that most microwave mug recipes are designed for:

3. Quick cooking times (usually 1-2 minutes)

Some tips for microwave mug cooking:
- Always use a microwave-safe mug
- Choose a mug that's slightly larger than the recipe volume to prevent overflow
- 6 oz mugs work best for most single-servin

Rotate proteins—no single main more than twice this week.
======================================================================
2025-11-30 15:54:46 [final] answer(len=792): I'll help you create a protein rotation plan for the week to ensure variety. Here's a suggested protein rotation for 7 days:

Monday: Fish (such as salmon or cod)
Tuesday: Chicken
Wednesday: Lean beef
Thursday: Plant-based (beans, lentils, or tofu)
Friday: Pork
Saturday: Chicken (second time this week)
Sunday: Seafood (shrimp or another fish variety different from Monday)

This rotation:
- Doesn't repeat any protein more than twice (chicken appears twice)
- Includes a good mix of lean proteins

Also, don’t repeat anything I’ve already had this week.

2025-12-01 16:56:46 [final] answer(len=1420): I notice that both sample meals I started to suggest (Bean & Egg Breakfast and Tofu Fajita Bowl) are already in your recent meal history. Let me create a completely fresh meal plan with no repeats from your history.
