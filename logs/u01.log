[2025-12-02 22:07:22.356806] Assistant: Here is a 7-day meal plan designed for your cutting phase, targeting approximately 1800 calories per day with high protein and fiber, Mediterranean and Mexican influences, and avoiding peanuts. This plan ensures no single main protein source is repeated more than twice and avoids repeating meals from your recent history. All measurements are in US units.

I will create a 7-day meal plan for your cutting phase, focusing on Mediterranean and Mexican flavors, with approximately 1800 calories per day, high protein (at least 30g per meal), and high fiber (at least 37g per day). I will ensure no peanuts are included, no main protein source is repeated more than twice, and no meals from your recent history are repeated. All cooking will be done on the stove or in the oven, and I will use US customary units.
