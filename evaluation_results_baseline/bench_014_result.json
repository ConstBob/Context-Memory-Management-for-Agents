    "Here are a few high-fiber recipe ideas, aiming for over 30 grams of fiber per serving:\n\n1.  **Lentil Shepherd's Pie with Sweet Potato Topping**\n    *   **Description:** A hearty and flavorful twist on a classic, this recipe uses lentils as the base for a protein-packed and fiber-rich filling, topped with mashed sweet potatoes.\n    *   **Estimated Fiber:** This dish can easily reach 30+ grams of fiber per serving, depending on the amount of vegetables and lentils used. Lentils are a fantastic source of fiber, and sweet potatoes also contribute significantly.\n    *   **Why it's high fiber:** Lentils, onions, carrots, celery, and sweet potatoes are all excellent sources of dietary fiber.\n\n2.  **Black Bean Burgers on Whole Wheat Buns with Avocado Salsa**\n    *   **Description:** Homemade black bean burgers are a delicious and satisfying alternative to meat. Served on whole wheat buns with a fresh avocado salsa, this meal is packed with nutrients.\n    *   **Estimated Fiber:** With black beans, whole wheat buns, and the vegetables in the salsa, this meal can easily exceed 30 grams of fiber.\n    *   **Why it's high fiber:** Black beans are a fiber powerhouse. Whole wheat buns provide more fiber than white buns, and ingredients like corn, bell peppers, and onions in the salsa add to the fiber content.\n\n3.  **Quinoa and Chickpea Salad with Roasted Vegetables**\n    *   **Description:** A vibrant and filling salad featuring quinoa, chickpeas, and a medley of roasted vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and bell peppers, all tossed in a light vinaigrette.\n    *   **Estimated Fiber:** This salad is designed to be very high in fiber, with quinoa, chickpeas, and a variety of vegetables contributing to a substantial fiber count.\n    *   **Why it's high fiber:** Quinoa is a complete protein and a good source of fiber. Chickpeas are legumes, which are exceptionally high in fiber. Roasted vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts are also fiber-rich.\n\nThese recipes are generally easy to prepare and can be customized with your favorite vegetables and seasonings. Enjoy!",
