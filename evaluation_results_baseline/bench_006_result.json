  "response": "Here are a few peanut-free \"cup\" style dessert options for you:\n\n1.  **Peanut-Free Peanut Butter Cups (Almond Butter Based)**\n    *   These recipes often use almond butter as a substitute for peanut butter. You'll typically find them made with chocolate chips and almond butter, sometimes with a touch of sweetener.\n    *   *Example Ingredients:* 16 oz almond butter, 11.5 oz milk chocolate chips, 1/4 cup powdered sugar.\n\n2.  **Vegan Almond Butter Cups**\n    *   Similar to the above, these are peanut-free and also dairy-free. They aim to replicate the classic peanut butter cup experience using plant-based ingredients.\n    *   *Example Ingredients:* 11.5 oz bag of vegan chocolate chips, 3/4 cup almond butter, 1/4 cup powdered sugar.\n\n3.  **\"Peanut Butter\" Cups (using alternative nut/seed butters)**\n    *   Beyond almond butter, other recipes might use sunflower seed butter or cashew butter to create a peanut-free alternative.
