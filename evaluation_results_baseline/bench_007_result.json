  "response": "Great! With a microwave and a rice cooker, you can prepare a variety of meals. Here are a few ideas:\n\n**Breakfast:**\n\n*   **Microwave Oatmeal with Berries:** Cook rolled oats in your microwave according to package directions. Top with fresh or frozen berries and a sprinkle of nuts or seeds.\n*   **Scrambled Eggs (Microwave):** Whisk eggs with a splash of milk or water, salt, and pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until cooked through.\n\n**Lunch:**\n\n*   **Rice Bowl with Steamed Vegetables and Tofu:** Cook rice in your rice cooker. While the rice is cooking, steam your favorite vegetables (like broccoli, carrots, or snap peas) in the microwave. Top the cooked rice with the steamed vegetables and some pan-fried or baked tofu.\n*   **Lentil Soup (Microwave):** Many lentil soup recipes can be adapted for the microwave. You'll typically sauté aromatics like onions and garlic in a microwave-safe pot, then add lentils, broth, and seasonings, and microwave until tender.\n\n**Dinner:**\n\n*   **Chicken and Rice (Rice Cooker):** Many rice cookers have settings for cooking chicken and rice together. You can season chicken pieces and place them on top of the rice before cooking.\n*   **Salmon with Asparagus (Microwave):** Place salmon fillets on a microwave-safe plate with asparagus spears. Drizzle with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Cover and microwave until the salmon is cooked through and the asparagus is tender.\n\n**Snacks:**\n\n*   **Microwave Baked Apple:** Core an apple, fill the center with cinnamon and a touch of brown sugar, and microwave until soft.\n*   **Popcorn (Microwave):** Use a microwave popcorn maker or a brown paper bag with popcorn kernels.\n\nDo any of these sound appealing, or would you like more ideas in a specific category?",
