    "Here is a 2-day Halal meal plan focusing on a low-glycemic approach, aiming for approximately 2000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day.\n\n**Day 1**\n\n*   **Breakfast (approx. 450 calories, 35g protein):**\n    *   3 large scrambled eggs cooked with 1 tsp olive oil\n    *   1/2 cup cooked steel-cut oats (prepared with water)\n    *   1/4 cup berries (e.g., blueberries or raspberries)\n    *   1 oz almonds\n\n*   **Lunch (approx. 600 calories, 50g protein):**\n    *   Large salad with:\n        *   4 oz grilled chicken breast (halal)\n        *   Mixed greens (spinach, romaine)\n        *   1/2 cup cooked quinoa\n        *   1/4 avocado\n        *   1/4 cup chickpeas\n        *   Assorted non-starchy vegetables (cucumber, bell peppers, tomatoes)\n        *   2 tbsp olive oil and lemon juice dressing\n\n*   **Dinner (approx. 700 calories, 55g protein):**\n    *   5 oz baked salmon\n    *   1 cup roasted Brussels sprouts with 1 tsp olive oil\n    *   1/2 cup cooked brown rice\n\n*   **Snack (approx. 250 calories, 20g protein):**\n    *   1 cup plain Greek yogurt (0% or 2% fat)\n    *   1 scoop (approx. 25g) whey protein powder (halal certified) mixed in\n\n**Day 2**\n\n*   **Breakfast (approx. 450 calories, 35g protein):**\n    *   Smoothie:\n        *   1 scoop (approx. 25g) halal whey protein powder\n        *   1 cup unsweetened almond milk\n        *   1/2 cup spinach\n        *   1/4 avocado\n        *   1 tbsp chia seeds\n        *   1/4 cup berries\n\n*   **Lunch (approx. 600 calories, 50g protein):**\n    *   Lentil and vegetable soup (homemade or low-sodium store-bought) - 2 cups\n    *   4 oz grilled lean beef (halal), sliced thinly\n    *   1 small whole-wheat pita bread\n\n*   **Dinner (approx. 700 calories, 55g protein):**\n    *   5 oz baked chicken thigh (skinless, halal)\n    *   1 cup steamed broccoli\n    *   1/2 cup cooked farro\n\n*   **Snack (approx. 250 calories, 20g protein):**\n    *   2 hard-boiled eggs\n    *   1 oz walnuts\n\n**Important Considerations for a Low-Glycemic Focus:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Non-Starchy Vegetables:** Fill your plate with leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, zucchini, etc.\n*   **Choose Whole Grains:** Opt for brown rice, quinoa, farro, steel-cut oats, and whole-wheat bread in moderation.\n*   **Include Healthy Fats:** Avocado, nuts, seeds, and olive oil help with satiety and slow down sugar absorption.\n*   **Lean Protein Sources:** Ensure your protein sources are lean and Halal certified.\n*   **Limit Added Sugars and Refined Carbs:** Avoid sugary drinks, white bread, pastries, and processed snacks.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n\nThis plan provides a framework. You can adjust portion sizes slightly to meet your exact calorie and protein targets, and feel free to swap similar low-glycemic, high-protein Halal foods.",
    "The main difference between an air fryer and a grill is how they cook food. An air fryer uses hot, circulating air to cook, while a grill uses direct heat. Some air fryers also come with a grill plate, allowing them to perform grilling functions. The settings on an air fryer can also be adjusted to mimic grilling, with lower fan speeds for a grilling effect.",
