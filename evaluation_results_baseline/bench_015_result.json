    "Yes, you can add 10–15g of protein to breakfast without raising daily calories by making smart substitutions.\n\nHere are a few options:\n\n*   **Swap some of your current breakfast carbs for protein:** For example, if you're having oatmeal, you could reduce the amount of oatmeal slightly and add a tablespoon or two of chia seeds or a scoop of protein powder.\n*   **Incorporate protein-rich ingredients:** Add a hard-boiled egg on the side, a small serving of Greek yogurt, or a sprinkle of nuts or seeds to your existing breakfast.\n*   **Choose lower-calorie protein sources:** Opt for lean protein sources like egg whites or a small portion of lean turkey sausage instead of higher-fat options.\n\nTo give you a more precise recommendation, I'd need to know what you typically eat for breakfast. However, by focusing on protein-dense foods and making small adjustments to other components, you can easily increase your protein intake without increasing your overall calorie count.",
