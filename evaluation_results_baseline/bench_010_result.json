  "question": "Can you tweak my Day 2 from that 3‑day plan—trim roughly 150 kcals but keep protein where it was?",
  "response": "Here are a few vegetarian and lactose-free meal ideas:\n\n**Breakfast:**\n\n*   **Tofu Scramble:** Sauté crumbled firm tofu with turmeric (for color), nutritional yeast (for a cheesy flavor), black salt (for an eggy taste), and your favorite vegetables like onions, bell peppers, and spinach. Serve with whole-wheat toast.\n*   **Overnight Oats:** Combine rolled oats with a plant-based milk (like almond, soy, or oat milk), chia seeds, and a touch of maple syrup. Let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. Top with fresh fruit and nuts in the morning.\n\n**Lunch:**\n\n*   **White Bean and Spinach Soup:** Sauté garlic and onions in olive oil. Add vegetable broth, canned white beans (rinsed and drained), and fresh spinach. Simmer until the spinach is wilted. You can blend some of the beans to thicken the soup.\n*   **Lentil and Black Bean Salad:** Combine cooked lentils and black beans with chopped red onion, bell peppers, corn, and cilantro. Dress with a lime vinaigrette made from lime juice, olive oil, cumin, and chili powder.\n\n**Dinner:**\n\n*   **Curried Lentils:** Sauté onions and garlic, then add curry powder, turmeric, and ginger. Stir in red lentils, vegetable broth, and diced tomatoes. Simmer until the lentils are tender and the sauce has thickened. Serve with brown rice.\n*   **Black Bean Soup:** A hearty soup made with black beans, vegetable broth, onions, garlic, and spices like cumin and chili powder. Garnish with avocado and cilantro.",
