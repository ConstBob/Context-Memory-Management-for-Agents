  "question": "I need a 7‑day halal plan at my usual 2000/150 targets, low‑glycemic. US units.",
  "response": "Let me revise the batch-prep protein plan with net carb counts:\n\nSUNDAY BATCH PREP PLAN (All proteins nearly 0g net carbs per serving):\n\n1. Air Fryer Batch (2-3 hours total):\n- 3 lbs chicken breast, divided into 3 marinades\n  * Lemon-herb (0.5g net carbs per 6 oz serving)\n  * Shawarma spice (0.3g net carbs per 6 oz serving)\n  * Mediterranean garlic (0.2g net carbs per 6 oz serving)\n- Cook at 375°F, 15-18 minutes per batch\n\n2. Grill Batch (1.5 hours total):\n- 2 lbs grass-fed beef steak (0g net carbs)\n- 2 lbs turkey breast tenderloin (0g net carbs)\n- Cook in batches at medium-high heat\n\nStorage Instructions:\n- Let proteins cool completely\n- Portion into 6-8 oz servings\n- Store in airtight containers\n- Refrigerate up to 4 days\n- Freeze extra portions up to 3 months\n\nNote: I've avoided all proteins from your recent meal history. The marinades are minimal in net carbs (primarily from garlic and spices) and won't significantly impact your daily carb limits.\n\nWould you like me to provide the marinade recipes with exact net carb calculations?",

    "I'll help you create a 7-day halal meal plan that meets your requirements:\n- 2000 calories per day\n- Minimum 150g protein daily\n- Low glycemic index foods\n- Maximum 20g net carbs\n- Using air fryer and grill as preferred cooking methods\n- All measurements in US units\n\nBefore I proceed with the full 7-day plan, I notice you've recently had:\n- Grilled Spiced Lamb Chops\n- Grilled Harissa Chicken\n- Grilled Beef Kofta Kebabs\n\nWould you like me to start with Day 1's detailed plan first to make sure it matches your preferences before proceeding with the full week? This way we can adjust if needed before mapping out all 7 days.\n\nEach day will be structured as:\n- Breakfast (~500 calories)\n- Lunch (~600 calories)\n- Dinner (~600 calories)\n- Snacks (~300 calories)\n\nWould you like me to proceed with Day 1's detailed breakdown?",
    "I understand you want to cap:\n- Dinners at 30g net carbs\n- Lunches at 40g net carbs\n\nBased on your profile and requirements, this aligns well with your overall daily maximum of 20g net carbs and low-glycemic focus. However, I notice there appears to be a conflict - your profile shows a maximum of 20g net carbs total per day, but you're requesting caps that would allow up to 70g net carbs (30g dinner + 40g lunch, as verified by calculator: 30 + 40 = 70g).\n\nCould you please clarify:\n1. Should we stick to your profile maximum of 20g net carbs total per day, OR\n2. Should we use these new caps of 30g for dinner and 40g for lunch?\n\nThis will help me provide meal suggestions that accurately meet your carbohydrate requirements.",
    "I understand you want meal suggestions using primarily the grill or air fryer, while avoiding your recent meals (lamb chops, harissa chicken, and beef kofta kebabs). I'll suggest some halal options that fit your equipment preferences.\n\nHere are some protein-focused options you haven't had recently:\n\n1. Air Fryer Turkey Breast\n- 8 oz turkey breast\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- Seasonings: garlic, herbs, salt, pepper\n- Served with air-fried asparagus\nNutrition: 45g protein, 2g net carbs, 380 calories\n\n2. Grilled Fish Kabobs\n- 8 oz halibut or cod\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- Lemon, garlic, and herb marinade\n- Grilled bell peppers\nNutrition: 42g protein, 4g net carbs, 340 calories\n\n3. Air Fryer Tandoori-Style Chicken Thighs\n- 10 oz chicken thighs\n- Yogurt-based marinade\n- Served with grilled cauliflower\nNutrition: 48g protein, 3g net carbs, 420 calories\n\nWould you like me to provide detailed recipes and instructions for any of these options?",
    "I understand you want me to ensure adequate fiber (minimum 30g daily) while staying within these limits:\n- Lunch max: 40g net carbs\n- Dinner max: 30g net carbs\n- Overall daily max: 20g net carbs\n\nTo boost fiber while keeping net carbs low, I'll suggest adding these low-carb, high-fiber vegetables:\n\n1. Leafy Greens (per 2 cups raw):\n- Spinach: 1.4g fiber, 0.2g net carbs\n- Kale: 2.4g fiber, 0.5g net carbs\n\n2. Cruciferous Vegetables (per cup):\n- Cauliflower: 2.5g fiber, 2g net carbs\n- Broccoli: 2.4g fiber, 2.4g net carbs\n\n3. Other Low-Carb Vegetables:\n- Zucchini (1 medium): 2g fiber, 3g net carbs\n- Asparagus (8 spears): 2.8g fiber, 2.4g net carbs\n\nWould you like me to revise any specific day's meal plan to incorporate more of these fiber-rich vegetables?",
    "I'll create a batch-prep protein plan that's halal-compliant and optimized for your grill and air fryer. This will help you prepare proteins for the week efficiently while avoiding your recent meals.\n\nSUNDAY BATCH PREP PLAN:\n\n1. Air Fryer Batch #1 (2-3 hours total):\n- 3 lbs chicken breast, seasoned in different marinades\n  * Lemon-herb\n  * Shawarma spice\n  * Mediterranean garlic\n- Cook at 375°F, 15-18 minutes per batch\n- Yields: 6-8 portions (6-8 oz each)\n\n2.
