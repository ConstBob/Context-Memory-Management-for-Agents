  "response": "Okay, here are a couple of halal grilling options that fit your macros, based on my search results:\n\n1.  **Mexican Charred Chicken Thighs with Green Beans (COOKT):** This meal contains 670 calories, 40g protein, 75g carbs, and 23g fat. While the protein is on point, the carb count is too high.

(https://www.facebook.com/shredhappens/posts/halal-cart-chicken-bowlthis-is-just-about-as-good-healthy-eating-gets-i-made-thi/1337482755044513/)\n3.  **Halal Cart Chicken (jalalsamfit):** Each serving contains 430 calories, 41g protein, 42g carbs, and 11g fat. The carb count is too high. (https://www.tiktok.com/@jalalsamfit/video/7296940974981319968?lang=en)\n\nConsidering your requirements, the **Halal Cart Chicken Bowl** seems like the most promising option, especially if you ensure the \"low-carb rice\" used is truly low in net carbs and fits within your 20g limit.",
