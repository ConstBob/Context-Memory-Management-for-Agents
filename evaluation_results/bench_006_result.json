    "Okay, I can help you brainstorm some high-protein, high-fiber Med/Mex-inspired meal ideas for a 1800 kcal cut. Since I don't have specific recipes or a nutritional database readily available, I'll focus on suggesting foods and meal structures that fit your macros and theme.\n\n**Key Strategies:**\n\n*   **Lean Protein Sources:** Chicken breast, turkey, lean ground beef, fish (tilapia, cod, salmon), shrimp, beans, lentils, Greek yogurt, eggs, tofu (if you're open to it).\n*   **High-Fiber Carbohydrates:** Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat tortillas), beans, lentils, vegetables (especially non-starchy ones like broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, zucchini), some fruits (berries, avocado).\n*   **Healthy Fats:** Avocado, olive oil, nuts, seeds. Use these in moderation, as they are calorie-dense.\n*   **Spice is Your Friend:** Mexican and Mediterranean cuisines are full of flavor! Use spices to make your meals satisfying without adding extra calories.\n\n**Example Meal Ideas:**\n\n*   **Breakfast (approx. 300-400 kcal):**\n    *   **Mediterranean:** Greek yogurt with berries, a sprinkle of nuts, and a drizzle of honey.\n    *   **Mexican:** Scrambled eggs with black beans, salsa, and a small whole-wheat tortilla.\n*   **Lunch (approx. 400-500 kcal):**\n    *   **Mediterranean:** Large salad with grilled chicken or chickpeas, mixed greens, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, and a light vinaigrette.\n    *   **Mexican:** Chicken or turkey breast with brown rice and fajita veggies (bell peppers, onions). Add salsa and a dollop of Greek yogurt.\n*   **Dinner (approx. 500-600 kcal):**\n    *   **Mediterranean:** Baked cod with roasted vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, bell peppers) and a side of quinoa.\n    *   **Mexican:** Turkey or lean ground beef and lentil \"taco\" salad with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, salsa, avocado, and a sprinkle of cheese. Skip the sour cream and use Greek yogurt instead.\n*   **Snacks (approx. 100-200 kcal each):**\n    *   Greek yogurt\n    *   A small handful of nuts\n    *   Hard-boiled egg\n    *   Vegetable sticks with hummus\n    *   A small piece of fruit\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Portion Control:** This is crucial for hitting your 1800 kcal target. Use measuring cups and a food scale to get accurate portion sizes.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n*   **Track Your Intake:** Use a food tracking app (MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, etc.) to monitor your calorie and macro intake. This will help you stay on track and make adjustments as needed.\n*   **Fiber Intake:** Aim for at least 25-30 grams of fiber per day.\n*   **Listen to Your Body:** Adjust your calorie intake and macros based on your hunger levels, energy levels, and progress.\n*   **Consult Professionals:** Consider consulting with a registered dietitian or certified personal trainer for personalized advice.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide medical or dietary advice.

Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine.*",
    "Okay! That's perfectly fine. Many delicious meals can be made without a blender. To give you the best suggestions, could you tell me what you're looking for? For example:\n\n*   **Are you looking for recipe ideas?** (e.g., \"Give me some easy dinner recipes I can make on the stove.\")\n*   **Are you trying to adapt a recipe that calls for a blender?** (e.g., \"This soup recipe calls for blending, how can I make it without a blender?\")\n*   **Are you looking for general cooking tips for stove/oven cooking?** (e.g., \"What are some good techniques for cooking vegetables in the oven?\")\n\nThe more information you give me, the better I can help!",
