    "Okay, I can help you with a cook-once, use-twice plan for batch-prepping two proteins. Based on the search results, chicken and tofu are both versatile options.

You can bake, slow cook, or cook them in a pressure cooker.\n2.  **Tofu:** Press extra-firm tofu to remove excess water. Then, bake or pan-fry it. Season with salt, pepper, and any other spices you like (garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, etc.).\n\n**Cook Once, Use Twice Plan:**\n\n*   **Day 1:** Chicken Stir-fry and Tofu Stir-fry.
