    "I understand you want to adjust the meal plan based on your experience that:\n- Eggs and chicken were more satiating than yogurt bowls\n- Keeping the 2000 kcal and 150g protein targets\n- Following previous restrictions (halal, low carb caps, etc.)\n\nLet me suggest a modified approach focusing on eggs and chicken:\n\nSUNDAY BATCH PREP:\n\n1. Air Fryer Chicken (2 hours):\n- 4 lbs chicken thighs and breast, divided into:\n  * Sumac and herb seasoned (0.2g net carbs/6oz)\n  * Middle Eastern spiced (0.3g net carbs/6oz)\n  * Garlic-turmeric (0.2g net carbs/6oz)\n\n2. Egg Prep (1 hour):\n- 24 hard-boiled eggs (0g net carbs each)\n- Sheet pan egg bake with spinach and herbs (1g net carbs/serving)\n\nWEEKLY BREAKFAST OPTIONS:\n1. Sheet Pan Eggs (15g protein, 1g net carbs)\n   + 2 hard-boiled eggs (12g protein, 0g net carbs)\n   Total: 27g protein, 1g net carbs\n\n2. 3-Egg Omelet with Herbs (21g protein, 1g net carbs)\n   + Air fried vegetables (2g protein, 3g net carbs)\n   Total: 23g protein, 4g net carbs\n\nWould you like me to continue with specific lunch and dinner combinations using these prepped proteins?",
    "I'll suggest some new meals that fit your carb caps while focusing on the proteins that worked well for you (eggs and chicken), avoiding all recent meals from your history.\n\nLUNCH OPTIONS (≤40g net carbs):\n1. Air Fryer Spiced Turkey Meatballs\n- 8 oz ground turkey\n- 2 cups cauliflower rice\n- 1 cup sautéed bell peppers\nMacros: 45g protein, 8g net carbs, 380 calories\n\n2. Grilled Salmon with Mediterranean Herbs\n- 7 oz salmon fillet\n- 2 cups grilled zucchini\n- 1 cup roasted mushrooms\nMacros: 42g protein, 6g net carbs, 390 calories\n\nDINNER OPTIONS (≤30g net carbs):\n1. Air Fryer Za'atar Fish\n- 8 oz white fish\n- 2 cups roasted broccoli\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\nMacros: 46g protein, 5g net carbs, 340 calories\n\n2. Grilled Lamb Skewers\n- 6 oz lamb cubes\n- 2 cups grilled eggplant\n- 1 cup bell peppers\nMacros: 38g protein, 8g net carbs, 420 calories\n\nAll meals can be batch-prepped, with vegetables air-fried or grilled in advance. Each option provides significant protein while staying well under your carb caps.",
    "Based on your success with eggs and chicken, I'll suggest how to add 10-15g more protein to breakfast while keeping calories stable at 2000/day. I'll reallocate some calories from other meals to accommodate this.\n\nBREAKFAST PROTEIN BOOST OPTIONS (all new, not in your history):\n\n1. Power Egg White Scramble\n- 3 whole eggs + 4 egg whites (instead of just 3 whole eggs)\n- Added protein: +12g\n- Added calories: +68\n- Net carbs: 1g\nLet's calculator: 24g protein (whole eggs) + 14g (egg whites) = 38g total protein\n\n2. Protein-Packed Breakfast Plate\n- 2 whole eggs\n- 4 oz grilled chicken breast\n- Sautéed mushrooms\n- Total protein: 42g\n- Net carbs: 2g\n- Calories: 310\n\nTo keep daily calories at 2000, I'll adjust by:\n- Reducing healthy fats slightly at lunch (-50 calories)\n- Trimming dinner portion sizes (-68 calories)\n\nThis maintains your daily targets while front-loading protein for better satiety throughout the day.\n\nWould you like specific meal timing suggestions to optimize this protein distribution?",
