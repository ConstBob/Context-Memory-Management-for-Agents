    "Yes, we can add 10-15g more protein to breakfast without significantly raising daily calories by making smart choices. Here are a few options:\n\n**Option 1: Extra Egg Whites**\n\n*   **Add:** 3-4 large egg whites to your existing eggs.\n*   **Protein Boost:** Approximately 10-12g protein.\n*   **Calorie Impact:** Minimal, as egg whites are very low in calories and fat.\n*   **Net Carbs:** Negligible.\n\n**Option 2: Lean Chicken Sausage (Halal)**\n\n*   **Add:** 1-2 links of a high-quality, low-carb halal chicken sausage.\n*   **Protein Boost:** Approximately 10-15g protein, depending on the brand.\n*   **Calorie Impact:** Moderate, but can be managed by slightly reducing other fat sources in the meal if needed.\n*   **Net Carbs:** Typically low, but check the label.\n\n**Option 3: Small Portion of Cottage Cheese (if not a yogurt bowl substitute)**\n\n*   **Add:** 1/2 cup of low-fat cottage cheese.\n*   **Protein Boost:** Approximately 12-14g protein.\n*   **Calorie Impact:** Moderate.\n*   **Net Carbs:** Low.\n\nTo keep daily calories around 2000, we would adjust other meals slightly if we add a more calorie-dense protein source like chicken sausage.

    "Here are two protein options for batch prepping, along with a \"cook-once, use-twice\" plan:\n\n**1.
