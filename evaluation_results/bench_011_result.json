    "Okay, I understand. You're looking for a meal plan that incorporates a variety of protein sources, with no single protein source dominating the week (appearing more than twice).\n\nTo give you a more tailored meal plan, I need a little more information.  Could you tell me:\n\n*   **What are your preferred protein sources?** (e.g., chicken, beef, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, eggs, dairy, etc.)\n*   **Are there any protein sources you dislike or are allergic to?**\n*   **How many meals per day are you planning for?** (Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)\n*   **Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences?** (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-carb, etc.)\n*   **How many days are you planning for?** (e.g., 7 days)\n\nOnce I have this information, I can create a sample meal plan that meets your needs.\n\n**Example (Assuming a 7-day plan, 3 meals a day, and no dietary restrictions):**\n\nHere's a very basic example to illustrate the concept.  This is just a starting point:\n\n*   **Day 1:**\n    *   Breakfast: Oatmeal with nuts and seeds\n    *   Lunch: Chicken salad sandwich on whole-wheat bread\n    *   Dinner: Lentil soup with a side salad\n*   **Day 2:**\n    *   Breakfast: Greek yogurt with berries\n    *   Lunch: Leftover lentil soup\n    *   Dinner: Baked salmon with roasted vegetables\n*   **Day 3:**\n    *   Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with spinach\n    *   Lunch: Tuna salad with crackers\n    *   Dinner: Beef stir-fry with brown rice\n*   **Day 4:**\n    *   Breakfast: Smoothie with protein powder\n    *   Lunch: Leftover beef stir-fry\n    *   Dinner: Vegetarian chili with cornbread\n*   **Day 5:**\n    *   Breakfast: Whole-wheat toast with avocado and egg\n    *   Lunch: Turkey and cheese roll-ups with vegetables\n    *   Dinner: Chicken and vegetable skewers with quinoa\n*   **Day 6:**\n    *   Breakfast: Cottage cheese with fruit\n    *   Lunch: Leftover chicken and vegetable skewers\n    *   Dinner: Pork tenderloin with mashed sweet potatoes and green beans\n*   **Day 7:**\n    *   Breakfast: Pancakes with syrup\n    *   Lunch: Salad with chickpeas\n    *   Dinner: Pizza with vegetables\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Portion Sizes:** Adjust portion sizes to meet your individual calorie and protein needs.\n*   **Variety:** This is just a sample. Feel free to swap out meals and ingredients to keep things interesting.\n*   **Snacks:** Include healthy snacks between meals if needed, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, or yogurt.\n*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.\n\nI look forward to helping you create a more personalized meal plan once I have more information!",
